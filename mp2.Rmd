## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life! lol so funny

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```
View(house_elections)
View(candidates)
View(committees)
View(contributions)

#Only trying to get the people who have ran twice.
rantwice <- house_elections %>%
  group_by(candidate_name) %>%
  summarize(N = n()) %>%
  filter(N == 2)

twice <- house_elections %>%
  filter(incumbent == "TRUE")

View(twice)
View(rantwice)

#Now trying to get the contributions made by each committee. we'll have to merge tables :'(((


contribution_filtered <- contributions %>%
  select(cmte_id, transaction_amt, cand_id)
View(contribution_filtered)

committee_premerge <- committees %>%
  select(cmte_name, cmte_id, cand_id)
  
View(committee_premerge)

merged_data <- full_join(contribution_filtered, committee_premerge, by = "cmte_id")

View(merged_data)

#how do we merge the committee and the candidate?

merged_data2 <- merged_data %>%
  mutate(cand_id = cand_id.x)

View(merged_data2)

premerge_twice <- mutate(twice, cand_name = candidate_name)
